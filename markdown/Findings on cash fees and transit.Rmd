## Introduction

Household costs are one of eight components of the IBGC Global Cost of Cash Study. Households pay for cash in three ways: they pay transaction fees on certain types of cash access, such as ATMs and money transfer. They also spend time and money getting to the point where cash is obtained. Using the most relevant available data from reputable international sources and our own survey evidence, we derive estimates of the national cost of cash on an aggregate and a per capita basis for as many countries as possible. 

As our research shows, cash confronts households with many other costs, such as crime, accident, impulse control, budgeting, and social obligations. Those costs are not estimated here.

```


Three channels of consumer cost are estimated below: transit costs related to cash access, time spent on cash access, and fees paid for access to cash. The cost of transit is the aggregate national cost that consumers pay in order to reach the point of cash access, regardless of whether that trip was a single- or multi-purpose trip. The time spent on cash access is the aggregate national cost of time spent to reach the point of cash access. Our calibration dataset does not record queue time in a systematic manner, so time spent in queues for cash access is ignored in this measure. Queue times can vary very widely based on geography, type of cash access point, and social context. Finally, fees paid for cash access are the transaction fees paid for access to cash, such as fees due for check cashing and ATM access.\footnote{Reviewers have pointed out that our survey methodology may have included borrowing fees as well as withdrawal and cash conversion fees in Mexico and India; but we are unaware of any better datasets on the price of cash access, and have chosen to use our own research.}

## Findings: Transit Costs

In a household with a breadwinner and a homemaker, the breadwinner will most often obtain cash outside the home. Depending on the country and occupation, the breadwinner may obtain cash through a bank, a bank machine, a salary office, a place of business, or any number of nonbank financial institutions. Depending on the country and context, the last category can include bank correspondents, money transfer operators, check cashing stores, and informal financial service providers. The cost consumers pay to reach any of these cash access points depends on many things: how far away the cash access points are, the quality of infrastructure, and the mode of transit used to reach a point of cash access.

Survey evidence on this topic is rare. We built a simple model of national transportation infrastructure and access from reputable international sources. We then calibrated that model using original survey evidence from Mexico. The estimates presented below are the predictions of that calibrated model for national aggregate costs of transit related to cash access.



National transit costs range from less than a million dollars to more than half a billion. 118 countries in our sample have model estimates for transit cost. Our data makes it easy to calculate on a national basis, a per capita basis, and to segment by region or by income group. Transit costs are estimated in US dollars, to facilitate international comparisons. The distribution of transit costs is summarized at Table \ref{tab:summtransit}.


```{r summary, echo=FALSE, results= "asis", comment="", tidy=T}
# cat("The national aggregate cost of consumer transit to reach cash access points \n is summarized here: \n")
tab1 <- as.matrix(summary(hhtransit$transcost)); colnames(tab1) <- c("Value (USD, millions)")
print(xtable(as.matrix(tab1, colNames=c("Quantile","Value (USD, millions)")), caption="Summary of national household transit costs", digits=0, label="tab:summtransit"), comment=F, caption.placement="top")
# attr(hhtransit$transcost, "var.label")

# options(digits=3)
# writeLines("By region:")
# summary(transcost~Region, data=hhtransit)
```


```{r boxplots, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
# options(scipen=5, digits=1)
boxplot(transcost~Region, data=hhtransit, las=1, ylim=c(1,200))
title(main="National transit costs by region", x="Geography",y="USD Millions")

boxplot(transcost~Region, data=hhtransit, log="y", las=1)

qplot(Population, transcost, data=hhtransit, label=iso2c, geom="text", log="xy")+
  labs(title="Transit costs v. population, log scale", x="Population",y="Transit cost, USD Millions")


```

In two-way scatterplots with national population, the highest costs per capita are in the upper left corner. The lowest costs per capita are in the lower right corner. The largest markets by headcount are farthest right. The largest markets by aggregate cost are at the top of the chart. Intraregional comparisons make it easier to see how individual countries differ from their peers.

## Findings: Fees

We estimate the cost of fees charged for cash transactions. Data regarding fees paid for cash access is exceedingly rare. Most often, survey evidence focuses on a particular channel of cash access, rather than all fees paid by consumers across different channels. Our study built a model of cash access transactions and the rates at which fees are charged on those transcations. The model was calibrated to original survey evidence in Mexico, India and the United States. 

Table \ref{tab:summcashfees} summarizes the distribution of national consumer cash access fees. Again, costs are reported in USD to facilitate international comparisons. Two-way scatterplots with population show where per capita costs are highest (upper left) and lowest (lower right).


```{r cashfees, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
require(doBy)
tab2 <- as.matrix(summary(remit$cashfees)); colnames(tab2) <- "Value (USD, millions)"

setkey(hhtransit, iso2c)
remitsumm <- hhtransit[,.SD,.SDcols=c("iso2c","Region","Lending","ATMd", "Population")][remit]
tab3 <- summaryBy(cashfees~Region, na.rm=T, remitsumm); colnames(tab3) <- c("Region","Average (USD, millions)")
print(xtable(tab3, digits=0, caption="National cost of cash transaction fees, by region", label="tab:cashfeesbyregion"), comment=F, caption.placement="top")

qplot(Population, cashfees, data=remitsumm, label=iso2c, geom="text")+

## Findings: Time spent

Consumers spend a great deal of time getting to and from the place where cash is obtained. We estimate the aggregate time on a national scale. Again, due to the dearth of observational data on when and how consumers obtain cash, we work backwards from some larger studies in order to model how much time consumers spend traveling for cash. Our study built a model of time required to obtain cash, based on the number of transactions and time spent per transaction. That model was calibrated to IBGC survey data in three countries, and then extrapolated to a large number of countries. The inputs to the model include aggregate time spent traveling for nonwork purposes per week, the density of ATMs per capita, and the fraction of the rural population with access to roads. The highest costs per capita occur in markets where travel is slow, financial infrastructure is scarce and access to roads is poor.


The number of transactions per month, as described above, refers to the number of times the individual is thought to receive cash payments. Ideally a good measure of time invested would also include time spent in queues for salary offices, ATM withdrawals, and in-person payments that could be processed more quickly by SMS or electronic payment.  We do not have good measures of all of those processes, and still less how much individual time might vary internationally for those processses.

One particularly important category of data we were not able to capture with our study methodology is *payday absenteeism*. It is common practice in some developing countries for salaried staff to be absent for hours or days when salaries are paid. When salaries are paid by bank transfer, workers sometimes need to visit the bank or ATM to withdraw cash. Cash withdrawals by teller must occur during banks' business hours. Where ATMs are prone to run out of cash, workers must queue to obtain cash as soon as funds post to the account.

## Data sources

World Development Indicators (WDI) is the World Bank's flagship study of human development. It includes national income and output, population, price levels, foreign exchange rates, infrastructure, and many other demographic variables.

Rural Access Index (RAI) describes the proportion of the rural population with access to roads. It is published by the World Bank occasionally.

Global Findex (WBGF) describes financial access with dozens of indicators related to account ownership, saving behavior, payment behavior. The survey is new; but is intended to be released regularly (perhaps every 2-3 years). Stratification by age, sex, urbanicity, and income quintile faciliates comparisons both within and between countries.

Remittance Prices Worldwide (RPW) and the Bilateral Remittance Matrix (BRM) are World Bank research projects that give insight into money transfer markets. RPW estimates the cost of specific transfer amounts in a variety of corridors (origin and destination countries). BRM estimates the total value of annual remittances between pairs of countries in the dataset.

The Centre for Time Use Research (CTUR) at Oxford University publishes a Multnational Time Use Survey (MTUS) that benchmarks individuals' average time spent traveling for a variety of purposes around the world.

Crucially, the Institute for Business in the Global Context's market research study,  Consumer Cash Habits (CCH), enables us to calibrate the rates at which populations incur costs for access to cash. We can estimate the share of the population that incur specific costs and the levels of those costs in the aggregate, for countries where we have primary data.

## Coverage

Several of the quantities in the dataset are estimated only by proxy. This dataset represents a rigorous and consistent methodology applied to extremely patchy underlying sources. As of December 4, a few large countries lack sufficient data to report consumer cash costs under this methodology: notably Australia, Canada, and Switzerland. The goal is to use widely accepted statistical models to generate plausible estimates for these countries. Virtually none of the quantities estimated in this dataset are directly observed; so constructing comparable data by proxy should neither enhance nor compromise the validity of the findings. Addressing missing data in international comparisons is considered beneficial and appropriate.
