## overview

IBGC is benchmarking the cost of cash worldwide. In order to do that, we rely on estimates of the rate of international remittances, domestic remittances and cash-out transcations in countries around the world. Missing data is a gigantic problem with remittances and cash transactions. 

Multiple imputation, first described in Rubin (1987), improved regression estimates from datasets corrupted by missing observations.\footnote{Rubin, DB. 1987. *Multiple Imputation for NOnresponse in Surveys*. John Wiley \& Sons, New York.} Software to accomplish this in R is available in open source, using packages `Amelia` and `Zelig` from the Comprehensive R Archive Network.\footnote{James Honaker, Gary King, Matthew Blackwell (2011). Amelia II: A Program for Missing Data. Journal of  Statistical Software, 45(7), 1-47. \url{http://www.jstatsoft.org/v45/i07/}; Matt Owen, Kosuke Imai, Gary King and Olivia Lau (2013).
