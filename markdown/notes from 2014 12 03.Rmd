## What I did today

I cleaned the remittance price data from October. Now I have estimates of remittance prices for 117 countries based on World Bank data. The data are summarized by sender and recipient, but averaged across four years of data, cash-out transactions only.

Cleaning the data better gave coverage in 117 countries, up from 42 previously.

With the improved price data, I can estimate national costs of fees.

### Datasets imported

1. Remittance Prices Worldwide (World Bank)

## To do

1. Crunch the numbers on cash transaction fees for the same.
2. Crunch the numbers on transit costs for the same.
3. Convert HH costs from LCU to international dollars using PPP exchange rates.
