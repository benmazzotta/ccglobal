## What I did today

I crunched the LCU numbers on household time invested in cash transactions. I included wages. Did not convert to international dollars. ~~ILO files also contain real wages; perhaps should use those instead of "nominal" chosen in today's scripts to facilitate international comparisons.~~ Instead, do conversions at PPP rates using WDI.

### Datasets imported

1. Rural Access Index (RAI) via World Bank
2. ILO Wage Survey (ILOWS)
3. ATM Density per capita (WDI)
4. Multinational Time Use Survey (MTUS)
5. CCH India, Mexico and USA data (IBGC)

## To do

1. Crunch the numbers on cash transaction fees for the same.
2. Crunch the numbers on transit costs for the same.
3. Convert HH costs from LCU to international dollars using PPP exchange rates.
